                <p>Sandgate is a small coastal village, located just thirty minutes north of Brisbane CBD but feeling
                    worlds away.</p>
                <p>Experience small town charm as you walk along Sandgate’s historic streets, packed full of small
                    specialty stores selling everything from fabric to clothing to home decor. You can still do all your
                    shopping on the high street, visiting bakers, butchers and a pop-up produce market on Wednseday’s
                    and Sundays.</p>
                <p>Or take a break from it all, strolling along the waterfront at high tide or exploring the mud flats
                    at low tide.</p>

            <div class="item-about item-3-about">
                <p>Sandgate is also packed full of great restaurants, cafés and bars. You can enjoy live music most
                    evenings of the week.</p>
                <p>There’s also plenty to keep you active during the day with the water front walk, parks, day spas and
                    even kite surfing hire.</p>
                <p>Enjoy a trip away that will leave you feeling relaxed and rejuvinated, without having to even leave
                    Brisbane!</p>

                <h4>About This Website</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="item-about item-5-about">
                <p>This nifty little travel website was designed & built by Sandgate local & QUT Interaction Design
                    student, Cait
                    Hopper. It was
                    built as an assignment for Web Prototyping.</p>
                <p><a class="body-link" target="blank" href="https://www.caithopper.design/"
                        aria-label="external link to Cait Hopper's portfolio page">You can see more of my work and my
                        contact details here!
                    </a></p>

                <p>With a love of all things mid century and a huge nostalgia for the fifties, sixties and seventies,
                    this
                    website was designed to appeal to Baby Boomers to get them to holiday in Sandgate... Or maybe even
                    move here (I’m looking at you Mum & Dad!)</p>

                <p>When designing this site I was having fun imagining what websites would look like if they'd existed
                    and been built in the seventies. This is my result... Although really they'd probably be a lot more
                    psychadelic!</p>
